TWX	AT&T: $40B bridge loan to help finance TWX deal, and no rush otherwise	To finance its $85B deal for Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) -- half of which is coming in cash -- AT&T's (NYSE:T) invited its "relationship banks" to join a $40B bridge loan, at around three ticket levels, Bloomberg reports.nBased on ratings of Baa1/BBB+ (and AT&T's ratings are on negative watch at the credit rating firms), the loan pricing may open at L+112.5 basis points, with a 10 bp commitment fee, and upfront fees of 20-30 bps.nThe company has BofA Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) on board to help finance the deal, though a $30B bond to help fund the deal won't be rushed as doubts remain about whether it will be completed.nThere's no reason to finance early given that ambiguity, a senior banker says. CreditSight analysts: "The merger may ultimately not be approved ... we feel the odds are around 50/50 at this stage."nSome three-quarters of the financing is expected to take place in the investment-grade market. And doing the deal now rather than waiting for more regulatory certainty could end up more expensive for AT&T.
T	Report: October sets record for M&A activity	With the help of a very big deal -- AT&T's (NYSE:T) $85B offer for Time Warner (TWX -0.9%) -- companies have set a monthly record for merger and acquisition activity.nFirms have agreed to M&A valued at more than $251B this month, Dealogic says.

	Stocks slip as new FBI probe into Clinton emails overshadows healthy GDP	Stocks pulled back from morning gains after the FBI said it was investigating newly discovered emails relating to Hillary Clinton.n"Regardless of the fundamental news we get next week, earnings or data, this may be the story for the next 10 days," says Wunderlich chief market strategist Art Hogan.n"How can the FBI reopen the case and resolve the thing in 11 days? That's what the market is worried about," UBS's Art Cashin says.nStocks had traded higher after a preliminary read of Q3 GDP showed the fastest pace of expansion since mid-2014, with the economy growing 2.9%.nFive of the 11 S&P sectors ended in the red, with health care (-2.2%) by far the worst performer as results and guidance from McKesson and Amgen pressured the group.nFor the week, the S&P 500 slipped 0.7% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.3%, while the Dow ended little-changed.nToday's trading volume was above the recent 850M average, as 941M shares changed hands at the NYSE floor.nU.S. Treasurys ended mixed, with the two-year yield shedding 3 bps to 0.86% and the benchmark 10-year yield losing one basis point at 1.85%.nWTI crude settled 2% lower at $48.70/bbl on doubts about OPEC's planned output cut, capping a 4.2% drop for the week in its biggest weekly loss since mid-September.

LVLT	Level 3 up another 3.9% as analysts measure CenturyLink merger prospects	CenturyLink (CTL -1.4%) is giving back some of yesterday's merger-chatter gains, but Level 3 Communications (NASDAQ:LVLT) is adding on, up another 3.9% today.nLevel 3 jumped 10.6% yesterday, and CenturyLink rose 10%, on a report that the two were in advanced talks to merge.nLevel 3's at $53.90 today (after closing at $46.92 on Wednesday), and it's looking for at least $60/share in a buyout and $65 "could be reasonable," says Raymond James, which cut CenturyLink to Market Perform from Outperform -- thinking that stock could trade sideways for the months it could take to close such a deal.nUBS sees the deal cresting $1B in synergies, given the companies' overlapping infrastructure. Analyst Batya Levi is assuming an all-stock deal at 9-11 times EBITDA and has CenturyLink at a Buy with a $36 price target (implying 18% upside).nOppenheimer's Timothy Horan, meanwhile, sees more of a 50/50 cash/stock split at a $60 valuation for LVLT. He's got CTL at Market Perform but boosts LVLT to Outperform at that $60 target.nAmong peers (and other potential targets) today: CCOI -1.2%, INXN +2%, GTT flat, ZAYO +1.9%, AKAM +0.9%, FTR -2.4%.
