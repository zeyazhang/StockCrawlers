BHI	General Electric/Baker Hughes deal to be announced Monday - WSJ	The roughly $30B deal would see the creation of a new publicly-traded entity comprised of Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI), GE's oil and gas business, and some cash from GE, reports the WSJ.nThe new company would have more than $25B in annual revenue and thus be of large enough scale to better compete with rivals like Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB).nThe structure of the deal also gives GE control of Baker Hughes without having to shell out for an outright acquisition.nPreviously: WSJ: GE, Baker Hughes could reach deal as soon as next week (Oct. 28)
FXB	Brexit for Mark Carney?	Bank of England Governor Mark Carney had previously planned to announce by year-end whether he would stay on past 2018, but word is he could make a statement as soon as this Thursday when he delivers the bank's quarterly inflation report.nThe Canadian has some egg on his face as he was a vocal member of the "Project Fear" contingent which promised economic apocalypse in the event of a U.K. vote to exit the EU. Since that early-summer vote, the FTSE has soared to new highs, British unemployment has come down, and this past week U.K. Q3 GDP breezed past forecasts.nThere's also the new government of Theresa May which isn't a fan of the BOE's QE program.nAmong potential replacements is Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, who hasn't been afraid to publicly criticize Carney. Earlier this month: "On every occasion [Carney] wants to talk down the economy and find doom and gloom, which doesnâ€™t seem to me to be the job of the governor of the Bank of England."nThe conventional wisdom says the pound could tumble further if the well-respected (at least outside of Britain) Carney announces his exit, but presumably his replacement would be at least somewhat more hawkish.nETFs: FXB, EWU, GBB, EWUS, FKU, DXPS, DBUK, QGBR, HEWU
EWC	EU, Canada sign long-delayed trade pact	After a bumpy ride, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has signed Canada's free trade agreement with Europe at a ceremony in Brussels.nThe Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement will remove 98% of tariffs - and officials hope it will generate an increase in trade worth $12B a year.nWhat about the much-debated trade deal between the U.S. and EU? "TTIP is not dead," EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom declared, adding that negotiations will continue after the November election.nETFs: EWC, CNDA, EWCS, FCAN, QCAN, HEWC
USO	Trouble brewing for an oil output deal	Non-OPEC producers made no specific commitment on Saturday to join OPEC in limiting oil output levels to prop up prices - a stance that suggests they want the group to first solve its differences.nA day earlier, OPEC members themselves were unable to agree on how to implement a deal to limit production amid objections by Iran which has been reluctant to even freeze its output.nDiscussions will continue late next month, just days ahead of the upcoming OPEC meeting on Nov. 30.nETFs: USO, OIL, UWTI, UCO, DWTI, SCO, BNO, DBO, DTO, USL, DNO, OLO, SZO, OLEM, OILK, OILX
