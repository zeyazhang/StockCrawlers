T	Senate antitrust members set Dec. 7 hearing on AT&T/Time Warner deal	The Senate's antitrust subcommittee has set a hearing on the proposed AT&T (T +0.5%) buyout of Time Warner (TWX -0.8%) for Dec. 7.nCEOs for the companies -- Randall Stephenson for AT&T, Jeff Bewkes for Time Warner -- are set to testify at the hearing.nUpdated: Bewkes will be the one to testify, though the subcommittee invited Rob Marcus, former chief of Time Warner Cable, instead -- as even the Senate can't tell apart Time Warner from TWC, the cable company that separated from TWX in 2009 and was sold to Charter earlier this year.
TRNC	Tronc, Gannett nosedive as reported funding withdrawal threatens deal	Tronc (TRNC -21.1%) and Gannett (GCI -14.1%) are diving together, on a Bloomberg report that a Gannett pursuit of Tronc is in doubt with banks reportedly withdrawing funding.nTronc shares had just moved up Tuesday on a report that Gannett was eager to get a deal done before Gannett's earnings today (didn't happen).nGannett has undergone a hostile pursuit for Tronc through the year, but recent reports had backchannel negotiations that got the acquisition price closer to $18.75/share. Tronc's at $13.43 and slipping.nSeveral lenders have withdrawn, Bloomberg says, over concerns about the health of both businesses at the $18.75/share valuation for Tronc. But the companies are reportedly working to try to salvage the deal.nGannett stock has been declining through the day after its profits missed expectations.
CMCSA	FCC adopts tougher rules on broadband customer privacy	The FCC split on party lines again today in adopting tough new privacy regulations on broadband Internet providers, rules that require an opt-in before sharing most customer data.nThat could present a problem growing advertising for big providers including Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), Charter (NASDAQ:CHTR), AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ).nThe vote passed 3-2 with strong dissents from the panel's two Republican commissioners. More public information (names, addresses) will be treated leniently, but providers will need to ask permission before sharing more sensitive data (like phone-tracked location, or sites visited and apps used).nThe new rules, while scaled back, have drawn heavy criticism from cable/telecom and advertising sectors, with companies that fret that the move will restructure the Internet's free-content approach.nOther players: OTCPK:ATCEY, FTR, CTL, WIN, S, TMUS, CCOI
