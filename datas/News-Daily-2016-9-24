T	White House: DOJ, FTC to decide on AT&T/Time Warner reviews	U.S. regulators will make their own decisions about whether they'll give a formal review to AT&T's (T -1.7%) deal to acquire Time Warner (TWX -3.1%), the White House says.nSpeaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, administration spokesman Josh Earnest says that deciding to review the deal will be up to personnel at the Justice Dept. and the Federal Trade Commission.n"Certainly when you consider the size of the deal ... I don't think anybody would be surprised if they announced a review," Earnest says. "The president would hope and expect that regulators would carefully consider the potential impact of this deal on consumers."nPrevious AT&T/Time Warner coverage
	M&A deals, earnings prop up stocks	Stocks closed higher following an upswing in M&A activity, but gains were limited by a rising dollar and falling oil prices.nAn M&A wave started over the weekend, as AT&T agreed to pay $107.50/share for Time Warner, a 20% premium over Friday's closing price, and Rockwell Collins agreed to buy B/E Aerospace for $62/share.nHowever, stocks backed off early highs, as crude oil futures fell as Iraq indicated it would seek an exemption from the proposed production freeze agreement; WTI crude briefly broke below $50/bbl before settling -0.7% at $50.52/bbl.nTech stocks (+1.2%) topped the leaderboard, as participants continued to assess quarterly reports from the sector and looked ahead to a busy week on the earnings calendar; Microsoft added another 2.3%, extending its post-earnings gain to 6.6%, and Alphabet gained 1.7%.nEight of the 11 S&P sectors ended positive, with consumer staples (+0.7%) and consumer discretionary (+0.7%) also outperforming; telecoms (-0.8%) and energy (-0.2%) finished at the bottom.nToday's trading volume was below the recent average of 853M, as 779M shares changed hands at the NYSE floor.nTreasury prices pulled back amid the upswing in equities and above-consensus economic data; the yield on the two-year note rose by 2 bps to 0.84%, while the yield on the benchmark 10-year note added 3 bps to 1.76%.
T	Considering possible $170B debt, Moody's puts AT&T credit on review	Moody's has put AT&T (T -1.5%) credit ratings on a review for possible downgrade after absorbing the impact of the carrier's $85B deal to acquire Time Warner.nThat comes as media investors swallow the idea that AT&T could pass $170B in debt after closing the deal, with average annual maturities of $9B starting in 2018.nThe ratings firm expects any such move on AT&T's senior unsecured rating (currently Baa1) to be limited to one notch, though.nIt will focus on pro forma capital structure, and whether AT&T is willing and able to bring leverage back down to around 3x. (Moody's adds its standard 0.7x to reported leverage to estimate gross leverage at AT&T will rise to about 3.5x).nEarlier AT&T/Time Warner coverage
T	AT&T/Time Warner call: 'You don't sit around and wait'	"The convergence in ... media and distribution is fast," says AT&T (T -1.9%) chief Randall Stephenson on a call (still ongoing) addressing the company's $85B deal for Time Warner (TWX -2.8%). "We want to be at the front of it; we don't want to be chasing it."nThe blockbuster deal gets the telecom giant some of today's best-known media brands via Warner Bros., Turner Broadcasting and HBO, but Stephenson singled out three keys: Superman, Game of Thrones and CNN.n"When Jeff [Bewkes, Time Warner CEO] and I met and both gained conviction about the art of the possible," Stephenson says, "you don't sit around and wait on perfect timing" for deals like this. Given the potential for leaks, "you go ahead and get them done."nExecs on the call were firm about the deal's chances with regulators. All the deals that have been in trouble over the past few years were horizontal, Stephenson says, with a competitor being taken out of the marketplace: "Jeff's company is a supplier to AT&T."nThe company line is that the legacy separation between content and distribution is getting in consumers' way, and the deal will provide downward pressure on consumer prices and upward pressure on choice. But TWX is trading at a deep discount to the deal so far this morning, likely on regulatory worries.nBewkes set straight notions that he'd be leaving the organization ("I'll be staying" for years) and Time Warner will be a wholly owned subsidiary of AT&T and will stay largely the same, says Stephenson. "I've never run a movie studio before," he adds.nAT&T CFO John Stephens says the cash portion of the half-stock deal is fully funded, with a $40B bridge loan combined with AT&T liquidity. The company likes the debt outlook despite the size of the deal: a net debt/EBITDA of "2.5 range" by end of the first year, approaching the range of 1.8 by the end of year four, and a $1B run-rate synergy by the end of year three. Free cash flow is expected to be accretive in year one, as with EPS.

T	Politicians and regulators to have their say on AT&T/Time Warner deal	Next up for the blockbuster $85.4B deal for AT&T (NYSE:T) to buy Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) is navigating the political landscape given what are certain to be objections by lawmakers and media/telecom rivals.nBefore the deal was even officially announced, Donald Trump was on the tape saying he would block it, while Clinton running mate Tim Kaine voiced his concerns a few hours later.nComcast's purchase of NBC Universal made it through in 2011, but not until after 13 months of review, and some have complained that conditions of the approval - such as its requirement to not weigh in on big decisions at Hulu - were tough to monitor and enforce.nNo stranger to making its way around D.C., AT&T is no doubt stealing itself for what lay ahead, but CEO Randall Stephenson on a Saturday night conference call played down regulatory concerns, arguing this deal isn't increasing industry concentration as it combines a content provider with a content distributor.
	European shares advance amid strong PMIs, Spanish political deal	Markit's manufacturing PMI for the eurozone rose to a 30-month high of 53.3, topping estimates of 52.6. Germany's print of 55.1 was a 33-month high, and France's of 51.3 was the strongest in 10 months.nMeanwhile in Spain, the re-election of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy was assured after the Socialist party decided not to block him from forming a minority government. While the ending of gridlock is good news, it's still a minority government, and likely to be weak and unstable.nEurope's Stoxx 600 is higher by 0.5%, led by Spain's 1.3% advance.
