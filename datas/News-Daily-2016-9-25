GOOG	Google Fiber CEO departs as business pauses new deployments	The chief of Google's Fiber business (GOOG -0.7%, GOOGL -0.9%) is out and the unit will pause development in cities where it's not yet active, and set up for layoffs.nIn a blog post, Google Access CEO Craig Barratt confirmed the moves.n"In terms of our existing footprint, in the cities where we’ve launched or are under construction, our work will continue," Barratt writes. "For most of our 'potential Fiber cities' — those where we’ve been in exploratory discussions — we’re going to pause our operations and offices while we refine our approaches."nIn the handful of exploratory cities and in some parts of the support operation, "we'll be reducing our employee base," he says, and "I’ve decided this is the right juncture to step aside from my CEO role. Larry [Page, Alphabet chief] has asked me to continue as an advisor, so I’ll still be around."nThe change-up comes months after Google Fiber acquired Webpass, largely seen as an admission that fixed wireless might be a preferable route to laying fiber in order to deploy last-mile high-speed Internet.
