T	Clinton concerned about AT&T/Time Warner; media firms want data	Those staring into tea leaves for a read on the likely approval of AT&T's (T -0.8%) deal for Time Warner (TWX +1.7%) would do well to heed the take of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who says the transaction calls for study.n"I think it raises questions and concerns, and they should be looked into," Clinton said on her campaign plane about the blockbuster deal. "If I'm fortunate enough to be president, I will expect the government to conduct a very thorough analysis before making a decision."nMeanwhile, according to what (currently anonymous) media execs are telling Reuters, media companies will press regulators to make AT&T/Time Warner divulge a mountain of customer data to blunt any potential unfair advantage in targeted ad sales.nThe combination would give the two possibly unprecedented viewing data about its customers. But there's no precedent for data access issues in an antitrust review, so rivals are pressing a tough case.nAT&T chief Randall Stephenson had acknowledged not only that data was a deal driver but that other providers might get access -- "To the extent that it keeps their content costs down, we'd be open to it," he said -- which suggests a happy medium could be reached for some price.nPreviously: Report: AT&T making millions off trading sensitive user info to law (Oct. 26 2016)nPrevious AT&T/Time Warner coverage

VZ	Verizon exec: Yahoo deal 'still makes sense' despite security breach	Verizon's (VZ -0.4%) $4.83B deal to acquire the core of Yahoo (YHOO -1.3%) still makes sense even in light of Yahoo's massive security breach, says Verizon exec Marni Walden.nThat doesn't mean Verizon doesn't still need more information about the intrusion, says Walden, the president of Product and New Business Innovation, speaking at a WSJ conference.n"The reason we wanted to get this asset is we wanted to increase the audience scale that we had at AOL," she says. "So it very much makes sense, but what we have to be careful about is what we don't know ... we're working closely with that team to try and better understand. And so I've got an obligation to make sure that we protect our shareholders and our investors ... so we're not gonna jump off a cliff blindly."n"We're hoping that in the next 60 days or less that we can have an outcome," she adds, "but right now they're conducting the investigation and will be providing us information."nCan she think of a scenario that would make Verizon walk away? "Why don't we move on to your next question?"nPreviously: Reuters: Yahoo mail-scanning government order unlikely to be publicized (Oct. 25 2016)nPreviously: Verizon call: Lawyers are talking over materiality of Yahoo breach (Oct. 20 2016)nVerizon/Yahoo coverage

T	Report: AT&T making millions off trading sensitive user info to law	Yahoo's been in crosshairs over a purported program made at the behest of government intelligence to spy on its users -- and now AT&T (NYSE:T) is being linked to creating a program to sell vital user information to law enforcement agencies for millions (of taxpayer dollars), according to a report in The Daily Beast.nAs with Yahoo, the AT&T report comes on the heels of critical M&A activity, as the telecom giant works to engulf Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) and become a media powerhouse.nThe telecom created a program called "Project Hemisphere" that warrantlessly bundles information on users, including their locations, and sells them to various agencies, the report says: “No warrant is required to make use of the company’s massive trove of data, according to AT&T documents, only a promise from law enforcement to not disclose Hemisphere if an investigation using it becomes public."nThe Daily Beast reported from AT&T's own documentation on the program, the article says.nThe nine-year-old program is used in 28 Drug Enforcement Agency centers, the report says, though law enforcement is insulated from the data, which is accessed by AT&T employees.
